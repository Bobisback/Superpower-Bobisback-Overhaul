I started this project to change some things that I did not like about the superpower mod. Most of these changes are personal taste. All changes are geared more towards the mutiplayer I play with my friends and this mod and through Gaint Mutiplayer Robot. Even though this is a mod most of the time I convert it to a fake dlc for use in mutiplayer with friends. Below is a list of changes I would like to make as compared to the default mod with a list of what I have done so far.

Things I have finished
1. DONE -25% to city attack melee navy (Only to Destroyer, missile destroyer)
2. DONE -25% to to land unit attack for ranged ships (dreadnought, battleship)
3. DONE -25% to land unit attack for militia naval units (Gally, Monitor, Corvette)
4. DONE Buff Monitor to 90 melee and ranged.
5. DONE Buff corvette to 150 melee and ranged.
6. DONE Buff gassion bonus. (Double )
7. DONE Double the city hp bonus for population size
    Current HP Bonuses:
    
    Town 0
    
    Small 50
    
    Medium 75
    
    Large 100
    
    XL 125
    
    XXL 150
    
    Global 200
8. DONE Buff siege units with 25% bonus to cities to make siege units more useful in city attack
9. DONE Change city capture to lose only 10% pop instead of 50%.
10. DONE Up the air limit in cities to 4 per city by default.
11. DONE Lower starting bonuses to AI difficulty levels, but increase the era bonuses especially late game. Leave science alone though. Reason: AI gets to strong at the start, but it is late game where they are to easy at. Hopefully this will somewhat fix this issue. They always techto fast though so we need to slow this down late game.
12. DONE Slow tech down in late game.   

    ERA_INDUSTRIAL 1.25x
    
    ERA_MODERN 1.5x
    
    ERA_WORLDWAR 1.75x
    
    ERA_POSTMODERN 2x
    
    ERA_INFORMATION 2.5x
    
    ERA_FUTURE  3x
13. DONE Doubled HP for infantry, hit and run, and tanks.
14. DONE Special forces now have a promotion that allows it to damage air units in the city they attack.
15. DONE Air units retreat from the city to nearest city while taking some retreat damage.
16. DONE Naval and land units retreat to nearest tile taking damage, and if no tile to go to they go to nearest city with huge damage.
17.  DONE Fixed a UI bug in hotseat.

Things I would like to do
1. Allow users to change focus on puppet cities. (Not sure how hard this will be)
2. I would love to update this dll of superpowers to the new community patch version.
3. I would like to merge the Civ 4 Diplo features mod
4. Merge the city states diplo overhaul
5. Merge the yet (not) another map pack
6. Create a way for the buttons to work over multiplayer. This is for the great general military academy as well as the mobilize demobilize for militia/workers. Currently these do not work for multiplayer. They show up but will desync the game if done by anyone other than host.
7. Create a dlc modpack for use in multiplayer. (This will be done for every release, currently this is the MP_MODPACK.zip. put this into your dlc folder in civ 5 directory to play multiplayer.)

Known bugs:
1. Fog of war is broken in some hotseat games.
2. The retreat will still delete units in certain cases, like the city they go to is still full.
